## Description

The language-tools for the CMMV project is a powerful development utility inspired by and built upon the foundation of the [Vue Language Tools](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools). This toolset is designed to provide robust support for TypeScript, Vue, and the CMMV framework components, facilitating a seamless development experience across these technologies.

At its core, the CMMV language-tools provide syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, type checking, and real-time error detection for TypeScript and Vue Single File Components (SFCs), ensuring that developers can quickly identify and resolve issues in their codebase. With native support for the CMMV framework, the toolset enhances the development workflow by adding specific tooling for CMMV components, which allows for auto-imports, custom component recognition, and deep integration with the CMMV contract-driven development model.

Similar to its Vue.js counterpart, the CMMV language-tools seamlessly integrates with IDEs like Visual Studio Code, offering an intuitive and developer-friendly environment. Through its support for both JavaScript and TypeScript, it provides flexibility for developers to write type-safe code with advanced type inference capabilities, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. Furthermore, the toolset understands CMMV-specific syntax, which enables developers to leverage the framework's unique contract-based communication and RPC handling in their Vue components effortlessly.

By combining TypeScript, Vue, and CMMV framework functionalities, the language-tools ensure that CMMV developers have all the necessary features to build complex web applications with ease, productivity, and confidence.
